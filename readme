BinIO
===============================================================================================
BinIO is a simplistic library for handling basic binary data types. 
Currently, it is designed to handle data written by itself, but interaction with data written 
by other software is possible too. 
BinIO works with little-endian data. Keep this in mind. 

You can use it by creating a buffer, filling it with some data ( eg. read a few bytes from 
a file, copy it from a memory lump, whatever ) seek to the buffer's start and start reading 
with its builtin functions.
Or, you can write to it with the builtin functions and flush it to a file. 

Currently handled data types:
	* char, unsigned char
	* short, unsigned short
	* int, unsigned int
	* float, double
	* null-terminated strings 

Also, I'm still mediocre at best with C++, so constructive critique is very well appreciated :)
